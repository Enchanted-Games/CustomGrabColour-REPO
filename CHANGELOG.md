# Changelog

## 2.0.0
v2 comes with a bunch of fixes and two much requested new features!

### New features / changes
- You can now customise the colour of your grab beam when rotating objects or healing other players!
   - Each beam type can be customised independently
- Added a new option that lets you automatically sync the beam colour to your skin colour
   - Even works with the CustomColors mod!
- By default, the neutral grab beam will now match your skin colour
   - To disable, simply set "Match Skin Colour" to "off" in the config menu

### Fixes
- The colour preview in the config menu is now much more accurate
   - Previously a lot of brighter colours would just appear white in-game, this has been fixed
- The tip of the grab beam will now properly update
   - Previously it would stay as orange until you rotated something or healed a player
- Other players grab beams will no longer reset back to orange until they grabbed something or healed a player when entering a new level
- Removed some error spam that could happen when other players changed their beam colour
  
## 1.1.0
- Updated the mod icon
- Made it so grabbing the cart will no longer force your grab beam to have 0.1 opacity until you rotated an item or healed another player
